# Security Assessment of the Totally Secure Math App

This document offers a thorough security assessment of the Totally Secure Math app, identifying and describing several vulnerabilities that could impact the app's security.

## Types of Vulnerabilities

1. [Insecure Data Storage](#insecure-data-storage)
2. [Improper Authentication](#improper-authentication)
3. [Code Injection](#code-injection)
4. [Insufficient Input Validation](#insufficient-input-validation)
5. [Insecure Code Practices](#insecure-code-practices)

## Insecure Data Storage

Insecure data storage occurs when sensitive information, such as user credentials or personal information, is not securely stored. This might include storing data in plain text or using weak encryption methods. Such practices can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, resulting in data breaches, privacy violations, loss of user trust, and potential legal consequences.

## Importance of Security Measures

Implementing these security measures is crucial for safeguarding the app and its users:

**Secure Data Storage:**

- Protects sensitive information from unauthorized access and breaches
- Ensures compliance with data protection regulations and standards
- Enhance user trust and confidence in the application's security

## Reflection and Lessons Learned

Through this security assessment, we learned the importance of implementing robust security practices:
**Secure Data Storage:**

- Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text or using hardcoded credentials
- Implement secure storage solutions for sensitive data, such as secure file storage systems or encrypted databases
- Ensure compliance with data protection standards and regulations to protect user privacy and data integrity
